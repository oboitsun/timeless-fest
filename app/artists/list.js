          Guy,&quot; and &quot;It&apos;s A Long Way There.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          Worldwide album and CD sales now top 30 million, and in 1982, LRB set a record for having
          had top 10 hits for six consecutive years – In fact, they were the very first band to
          achieve that remarkable plateau! According to BMI, &quot;Reminiscing&quot; has garnered
          rare status with over 5 million air plays on American radio, and &quot;Lady&quot; is close
          behind with over 4 million air plays.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bassist/vocalist Wayne Nelson joined the band in 1980 and worked alongside founding
          members with some of the most distinctive harmonies and vocal abilities, creating the
          unique LRB sound. In 1981, Nelson was recognized by world-renowned Beatles producer Sir
          George Martin who, while producing &apos;Time Exposure,&apos; chose Nelson to record lead
          vocals on two of the band&apos;s biggest hits, &quot;The Night Owls&quot; and &quot;Take
          It Easy On Me.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          Later that same year, guitarist extraordinaire Stephen Housden joined LRB, bringing a rock
          element into the band&apos;s sound and helping contribute to their string of top 10 hits.
          As band members departed one by one, Housden and Nelson worked together to bring LRB into
          the new millennium.
        </p>

        <p>
          To date, Nelson&apos;s vocal and bass guitar talents are included on 23 Little River Band
          albums/CDs. Although Housden has retired from touring, LRB continues to perform to
          sold-out audiences, and Stephen continues to write and participate in all things Little
          River Band.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2004, LRB was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association Hall of Fame
          at the 18th Annual ARIA Music Awards. And in September 2015, the band was awarded Casino
          Entertainer of the Year at the G2E Gaming Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada.

          Turning the page brings us to the current lineup of Little River Band … Keyboardist Chris
          Marion is a Dove Award-winning producer. Chris is the creator of all the orchestral
          arrangements and charts on The Big Box. It is amazing to watch him play, sing, and conduct
          from his riser!
        </p>

        <p>
          Nashville singer-songwriter and guitarist Bruce Wallace plays rhythm guitar and adds a new
          layer to the vocal harmonies. The addition of Bruce to the line-up has added to the energy
          of the already highly energized LRB.
        </p>

        <p>
          Drummer Ryan Ricks has locked down the rhythm section and rounds out the vocals with his
          incredible range. Great singing drummers are rare, and LRB is lucky to have Ryan as part
          of that all-important vocal blend.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nashville guitarist Colin Whinnery plays rhythm and lead guitar, and shares lead vocal
          duties with Wayne. He brings a brand new voice and a fresh outlook to the rhythm section.

          Early 2014 saw the release of Little River Band&apos;s &quot;Cuts Like a Diamond,&quot; on
          Frontiers Records. &quot;What If You&apos;re Wrong,&quot; went to #1 and stayed there for
          three weeks, says Jim Shoe of CLASSX Radio. &quot;Forever You, Forever Me,&quot; and
          &quot;You Dream, I&apos;ll Drive,&quot; both climbed into the station&apos;s TOP 3.
        </p>

        <p>
          In November 2016, LRB released &quot;The Hits…Revisited,&quot; on Wurld Records – a CD
          consisting of nine re-recorded hits along with two new songs, written by Wayne, Chris, and
          Rich. Kris Kristofferson attended one of their concerts in California. He came backstage
          after the concert and told LRB that their harmonies are “better than the Beatles.”
        </p>

        <p>
          May of 2017 brought the release of &quot;The Big Box&quot; – a box set consisting of six
          discs and featuring a DVD with live footage from their 40th Anniversary Tour.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2020, lead singer and bass player Wayne Nelson celebrated a personal and professional
          milestone of being a member of Little River Band for 40 years. That makes Wayne Nelson the
          longest-standing member in the history of LRB. In partnership with Time Life, the band
          released a “Live” orchestral accompanied CD of the hits called &quot;Black Tie.&quot; This
          masterpiece of audio golden nuggets continues to thrill and soothe today.
        </p>

          In 2021, the CD &quot;Fan Favourites&quot; was released to the fans after they voted on
          their favorite songs from albums released since the year 2000. This album is a fan
          exclusive and continues to receive rave reviews from the beloved “Night Owls.” Bringing
          their vocal and musical energy along with great arrangements to their timeless classic
          hits, each show creates new memories for the audience. The band enjoys watching their fans
          fall in love with the songs all over again as they are swept up by the show&apos;s
          powerful performance and the volume of hits from LRB&apos;s history.
        </p>

        <p>
          With over 100 dates scheduled or being scheduled for their 2021-22 tour, Little River Band
          is hotter than ever – selling out shows and making music from coast to coast – continuing
          their legacy of being “the best singing band in the world.”
