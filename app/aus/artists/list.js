        Through the &apos;70s and &apos;80s, Little River Band (LRB) enjoyed huge chart success with
        multi-platinum albums and chart-topping hits like: &quot;Reminiscing,&quot; &quot;Cool
        Change,&quot; &quot;Lonesome Loser,&quot; &quot;The Night Owls,&quot; &quot;Take It Easy On
        Me,&quot; &quot;Help Is on Its Way,&quot; &quot;Happy Anniversary,&quot; &quot;We Two,&quot;
        &quot;Man On Your Mind,&quot; &quot;The Other Guy,&quot; and &quot;It&apos;s A Long Way
        There.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        Worldwide album and CD sales now top 30 million, and in 1982, LRB set a record for having
        had top 10 hits for six consecutive years – In fact, they were the very first band to
        achieve that remarkable plateau! According to BMI, &quot;Reminiscing&quot; has garnered rare
        status with over 5 million air plays on American radio, and &quot;Lady&quot; is close behind
        with over 4 million air plays.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bassist/vocalist Wayne Nelson joined the band in 1980 and worked alongside founding members
        with some of the most distinctive harmonies and vocal abilities, creating the unique LRB
        sound. In 1981, Nelson was recognized by world-renowned Beatles producer Sir George Martin
        who, while producing &apos;Time Exposure,&apos; chose Nelson to record lead vocals on two of
        the band&apos;s biggest hits, &quot;The Night Owls&quot; and &quot;Take It Easy On Me.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        Later that same year, guitarist extraordinaire Stephen Housden joined LRB, bringing a rock
        element into the band&apos;s sound and helping contribute to their string of top 10 hits. As
        band members departed one by one, Housden and Nelson worked together to bring LRB into the
        new millennium.
      </p>

      <p>
        To date, Nelson&apos;s vocal and bass guitar talents are included on 23 Little River Band
        albums/CDs. Although Housden has retired from touring, LRB continues to perform to sold-out
        audiences, and Stephen continues to write and participate in all things Little River Band.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2004, LRB was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry As&apos;iation Hall of Fame
        at the 18th Annual ARIA Music Awards. And in September 2015, the band was awarded Casino
        Entertainer of the Year at the G2E Gaming Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada.
      </p>

      <p>
        Turning the page brings us to the current lineup of Little River Band … Keyboardist Chris
        Marion is a Dove Award-winning producer. Chris is the creator of all the orchestral
        arrangements and charts on The Big Box. It is amazing to watch him play, sing, and conduct
        from his riser!
      </p>

      <p>
        Nashville singer-songwriter and guitarist Bruce Wallace plays rhythm guitar and adds a new
        layer to the vocal harmonies. The addition of Bruce to the line-up has added to the energy
        of the already highly energized LRB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Drummer Ryan Ricks has locked down the rhythm section and rounds out the vocals with his
        incredible range. Great singing drummers are rare, and LRB is lucky to have Ryan as part of
        that all-important vocal blend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nashville guitarist Colin Whinnery plays rhythm and lead guitar, and shares lead vocal
        duties with Wayne. He brings a brand new voice and a fresh outlook to the rhythm section.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early 2014 saw the release of Little River Band&apos;s &quot;Cuts Like a Diamond,&quot; on
        Frontiers Records. &quot;What If You&apos;re Wrong,&quot; went to #1 and stayed there for
        three weeks, says Jim Shoe of CLASSX Radio. &quot;Forever You, Forever Me,&quot; and
        &quot;You Dream, I&apos;ll Drive,&quot; both climbed into the station&apos;s TOP 3.
      </p>

      <p>
        In November 2016, LRB released &quot;The Hits…Revisited,&quot; on Wurld Records – a CD
        consisting of nine re-recorded hits along with two new songs, written by Wayne, Chris, and
        Rich. Kris Kristofferson attended one of their concerts in California. He came backstage
        after the concert and told LRB that their harmonies are “better than the Beatles.”
      </p>

      <p>
        May of 2017 brought the release of &quot;The Big Box&quot; – a box set consisting of six
        discs and featuring a DVD with live footage from their 40th Anniversary Tour.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020, lead singer and bass player Wayne Nelson celebrated a personal and professional
        milestone of being a member of Little River Band for 40 years. That makes Wayne Nelson the
        longest-standing member in the history of LRB. In partnership with Time Life, the band
        released a “Live” orchestral accompanied CD of the hits called &quot;Black Tie.&quot; This
        masterpiece of audio golden nuggets continues to thrill and soothe today.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2021, the CD &quot;Fan Favourites&quot; was released to the fans after they voted on
        their favorite songs from albums released since the year 2000. This album is a fan exclusive
        and continues to receive rave reviews from the beloved “Night Owls.” Bringing their vocal
        and musical energy along with great arrangements to their timeless classic hits, each show
        creates new memories for the audience. The band enjoys watching their fans fall in love with
        the songs all over again as they are swept up by the show&apos;s powerful performance and
        the volume of hits from LRB&apos;s history.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over 100 dates scheduled or being scheduled for their 2021-22 tour, Little River Band
        is hotter than ever – selling out shows and making music from coast to coast – continuing
        their legacy of being “the best singing band in the world.”

      <p>
        In 2019, she released Between the Earth and the Stars, another contemporary record with nods
        to past moments from her 50-year career. She recorded it with David Mackay, who produced her
        first two albums back in the 70s. Songwriters include long-time collaborators Kevin Dunne,
        Brian Cadd and Stuart Emerson, with new contributions from Sir Barry Gibb and Amy Wadge. The
        album also boasts three exciting duets with Rod Stewart, Cliff Richard and Francis Rossi.

      <p>
        Her last album The Best Is Yet to Come – released in 2021 – is a contemporary approach to

        By the mid-80s they were world-wide superstars however, relationships cracked and the band
